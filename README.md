# Solar-System
Assignment for JavaScript course


The purpose of this exercise was to practice what we learned in the course and acknowledge how to manage libraries like three.js that we never seen before.
We didn't have to make a perfect solar system, measures and speed of the celestial bodies didn't need to be proportionally to the real ones. The focus was to learn how to handle shadows and rotations.
I wanted to do something more so I do want to do something that reflect the reality until a certain point.
So the planets here have dimensions and rotations speed in scale compared to the real solar system.
This involves some issues: Pluto is too small, some planet are too fast, others too slow.
Then I decided to implement the chance to move into the universe through mouse inputs.
By the way I realized that controls was a little odd, so I fixed it adding buttons that allows you to select the celestial body you prefer to observe.
The last thing I implemented was the buttons you can use to increase or decrease rotations speed.
